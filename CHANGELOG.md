All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- Phase 6 release artifacts: version bump, changelog entry, README updates.

### Changed
- Navigation (light theme) text visibility improved: items, action buttons, and online status now use high-contrast colors.
- Scanner page layout: "Ready to scan" status text moved and centered above metrics within the same box; progress bar aligned.
- Mobile navigation polish: increased touch targets (≥44px), high-contrast text for drawer items, action buttons, close button, and footer status.

### Verified
- Live validation on running SPA server (`python server.py`) for dashboard and scanner pages in both light and dark themes.

### Notes
- Backend/API integration and production build remain out of scope for this release; app serves as a static SPA.

## Previous
- Prior iterations focused on building the SPA pages and mock data flows.
